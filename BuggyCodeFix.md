# Buggy Code Fix Report

Issues Identified & Fixes Applied

# 1. Incorrect Namespace
Bug: `namespace App\Https\Controllers;` (Incorrect capitalization)
Fix: Changed to `namespace App\Http\Controllers;` since Laravel uses `Http` (not `Https`).

# 2. Incorrect Import Statements
Bug: `use Illuminate\Https\Request;` (Incorrect import)
Fix: Changed to `use Illuminate\Http\Request;`.

Bug: `use DB;` (Missing proper import)
Fix: Changed to `use Illuminate\Support\Facades\DB;`.

# 3. Missing Authentication Middleware
Issue: No authentication protection was applied.
Fix: Added `$this->middleware('auth')->except(['index']);` to ensure only authenticated users can modify tasks.

# 4. No Validation for Requests
Issue: Task creation and update methods didn't validate incoming data.
Fix: Added Laravel validation for `title`, `description`, `status`, and `due_date`.

# 5. Used Manual Property Assignment Instead of Mass Assignment
Issue: Properties were assigned one by one in `store()` and `update()`, making the code repetitive.
Fix: Used `$validated = $request->validate([...])` and `Task::create($validated)` for cleaner and safer mass assignment.

# 6. Task Not Checked Before Updating or Deleting
Issue: `find($id)` was used without checking if the task exists.
Fix: Replaced `find($id)` with `findOrFail($id)` to return a 404 error if the task doesnâ€™t exist.

# 7. Optimized Task Retrieval
Issue: `Task::all()` was fetching tasks without ordering.
Fix: Changed to `Task::orderBy('created_at', 'desc')->get();` so newer tasks appear first.

# Conclusion
With these fixes, the code is now:
**More secure** (authentication added)  
**More reliable** (validations added)  
**More optimized** (ordering & better queries)  
**Less error-prone** (checks for task existence)  

Now the API is **fully functional and optimized**.
